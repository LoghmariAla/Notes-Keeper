            <h2>Free Palestine</h2>
            <p>
                The call for a free Palestine is a fundamental demand for the right of the Palestinian people to live in freedom and self-determination, free from occupation and oppression.
            </p>
            <p>
                This aspiration for freedom is at the heart of the Palestinian struggle, and it is essential for the international community to support this cause and work towards a just and lasting solution.
